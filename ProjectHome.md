REAL NAME:
"Naruto Hand Seals Fighting"

The all project is a fighting game with the borrowed environment of the just notorious
"Naruto" anime.
The didactic aim in this project focuses on the purpose of an augmented reality section in which the player have to interact with his/her own hands and fingers with the system through the webcam.
In the current section we'll implement the engine recognition of the hand signs and a little training section for the user to became familiar to some signs.
